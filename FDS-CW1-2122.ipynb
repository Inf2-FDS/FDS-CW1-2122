You are free to form study groups and discuss the concepts related to, and the high-level approach to the coursework. **You may never share code or share write-ups**. It is also not permitted to discuss this coursework on Piazza. The only exception is that if you believe there is an error in the coursework, you may ask a private question to the instructors, and if we feel that the issue is justified, we will send out an announcement.\n",

    "## Assessment information and criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment accounts for 20% of the grade for this course.\n",
    "- It is graded based on the PDF export from a Jupyter notebook (see __General instructions__ below), which you are to submit via Gradescope (see __Assessment/Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn).\n",
    "- The assignment is marked out of 100 and the number of points is indicated by each question. \n",
    "- We will assess your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "  - functional code that performs the computations asked for, as measured by verifying some of the numeric outputs from your processing and reading your code if there is doubt about what you have done\n",
    "  - the quality of the visualisations, measured against the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ handout in the S1 Week 5 workshop (PDF available in S1 Week 5 folder in Learn)\n",
    "  - the quality of your textual comments - as measured by how accurate, complete and insightful they are.\n",
    " \n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions carefully, answering what is required and only that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in your answers in the cells indicated. You may delete text like \"Your answer to Q1.2 goes here\". __Do not edit or delete any other cells.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving visualisations, make sure to label them clearly and provide legends where necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving numerical values, use correct units where appropriate and format floating point values to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished a question, use a Jupyter notebook server to export your PDF, by selecting __File->Download as->PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check this PDF document looks as you expect it to. If changes are needed, update the notebook and export again.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this exercise we wish to compare how migration has changed in different European regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide further information about individual countries in the file `migration_data/Countries.csv`. This includes: the country's name; the country code; its population in 2011 stated in millions of inhabitants; and what larger region it belongs to according to the multidisciplinary thesaurus (controlled vocabulary) [EuroVoc](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies). The idea is that the four regions (North, West, South, East) have different population sizes, which directly affects the number of migrants associated with each region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we want to find the net migration of each region for each year, and scale it appropriately. By \"appropriately\" we mean that the scaling factor should be the sum of the populations of all contributing countries from that region for that year - e.g., Czechia does not provide any data for year 1991, so its population will not be considered in the scaling factor for Eastern Europe for that year. On the other hand, Slovakia and Croatia are countries classified in the Eastern Europe region with data available for 1991, hence their individual populations will contribute towards the sum that represents the region's scaling factor for that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have all the net migration values scaled for each region for each of the 30 years within our dataset, we want a plot of the distributions of the scaled net migration for the four regions over the three decades - one distribution per region per decade.\n",
